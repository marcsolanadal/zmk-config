# ZMK CONFIG
---

This is my firmware configuration for [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/).

## My journey

My layout started in a Ferris Sweep so I only had two availabe thumb keys. Since I also use Colemak it made sense to use a layout based on [Seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/). 

Now I'm using a Corne. Having three thumb keys opens the possibility to have mouse movements and other features I want to try.
One problem I have with my keymap is that using the space/shift on both hands takes too much real state in the thumb cluster. To solve the issue I've started experimenting with only moving the SHFT key into home-row mods.
If I see that I can get used to home-row mods, I'll start transitioning my layout to something resembling [Mirioku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku). 

## Distinctive features 

I did so many modifications to the layout that it no longer resembles the original one. Here a none exhaustive list of modifications:

- Moved the arrow positioning to emulate vim
- Tried to group most of the symbols and numbers under the symbol layout.
    - For breakets, curly braces and parenthesis I use tap dance to complete the closing pair. This is not cumbersome since most IDEs autocomplete the closing pair.
- SPACE/SHIFT on every thumb (currently transitioning out of it).
