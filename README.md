# ZMK CONFIG
---

This is my firmware configuration for [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs/).

My layout started in a Ferris Sweep so I only had two availabe thumb keys. 

Since I also use Colemak it made sense to use a layout based on [Seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/). 
I did so many modifications to the layout that it no longer resembles the original one.

Here a none exhaustive list of modifications:

- Moved the arrow positioning to emulate vim
- Tried to group most of the symbols and numbers under the symbol layout.
    - For breakets, curly braces and parenthesis I use tap dance to complete the closing pair. This is not cumbersome since most IDEs autocomplete the closing pair.

> Home-row mods aren't for me since I usually mess up my typing. I feel sticky one-shot modifiers work really well for me.
